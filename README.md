# Reproducible-Research-GITHub-GIS-Deliverable-CLRCAT008

Due to challenges with aquiring useable topographic map data for use in this project, I have decided to create a map using iNat data of the small mammal species which had been captured and recorded for data in my honours project (namely: Rhabdomys pumilio, Otomys irroratus, Gerbilliscus afra, Mus minutoides, Crocidura cyanea, Elephantulus edwardii, and Micaelamys namaquensis).

It can be seen from the map that most sightings do occur in areas which are more populated with people, which makes sense - as the data was obtained from iNat.
